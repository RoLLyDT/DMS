# 2059

Patt and Max CW for Developing Maintainable Software (COMP2059 UNNC)


Brainstorming Ideas and Approx Timetable 
Date: 17 Nov 2022 First Online Meeting (for 1 hour)

We started Brainstorming ideas such as functions, special effects, ads on and so on

Minimal fixes plan:
- Add sound effect to the game (eg. background music, laser gun, asteroid explosion, etc)
- Make Asteroid appears from the top of the game, not randomly appears. (movement speed, normal size)

Features:
1. Amount of levels (varies by difficulty)
2. Limit world edges
3. Improvement on the game visual/ game object/ in-game interface (health bar) 
4. Function to upgrade weapons (varies by level) 
5. Ability to choose skin/design of the rocket before starting the game.
