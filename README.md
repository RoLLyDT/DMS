#AE2DMS-CW-MINECRAFT

Brainstorming Ideas and Approx Timetable 
We started Brainstorming ideas (Not fully implemented)
Minimal fixes plan:
- Add sound effect to the game (eg. background music, laser gun, asteroid explosion, etc)
- Make Asteroid appears from the top of the game, not randomly appears. (movement speed, normal size)
Planned Features(Not fully implemented) :
1. Amount of levels (varies by difficulty)
2. Limit world edges
3. Improvement on the game visual/ game object/ in-game interface (health bar) 
4. Function to upgrade weapons (varies by level) 
5. Ability to choose skin/design of the rocket before starting the game.


**Our Achievement as a TEAM**
<br/>
_Gitlab_
We used most of GitLab functions such as Milestone, commit, Git Branch, Merge Request, commit, etc, for the best experience of using GitLab and we are more confident with using Gitlab that we do in the beginning of the semester. 

_Refactoring_
We refactored code to improve design, structure and implementation of Space Asteroid game. Refactoring also help with code readability. For the refacoring part of SpaceAsteroid game, we did OO Design Pattern (State, Factory Method, Singleton, Abstract Factory Pattern), code simplification, code maintenance, divide class/methods into multiple java class files. MVC Design Pattern (Model-View-Controller), implement GUI using Scene Builder. 

_Additional Features_
We added multiple features such as different bullets based on level, shuttle velocity on 3rd stage, varies by difficulties, limit world edges for shuttle and asteroids, ability to change background (Up to 3 background), background music and sound effect(laser and explosion sound effect),

Collaborative efforts in refactoring, features implementation and code design led to the desired results.
Max's Part: 
- Most of the classes - code amount reduce and simplification 
- Moved classes by folders 
- helped with fixing background, when I was in quarantine 
- All game features (multiple bullets based on level, shuttle velocity on 3rd stage, change of difficulties(speed+amount of asteroids),world edges for shuttle and asteroids) 
- UML diagram

Patt's Part:
- I did divide classes/methods that Maksim refactored before from one java file to multiple java class files 
- GUI with Scene Builder for Main screen(Hello.FXML), page 2, page 3, page 4 
- Added Controller class and Model class 
- Did Javadocs for every classes 
- Edit video and add subtitles 
- Added background music, sound effect for laser and explosion 

What we did together: 
- Finalize MVC Design Pattern
- OO Design Pattern 
- Background option (Background 1, 2, 3) and implemented it in Option Page of FXML 
- Minimal bugs fixes 

Problem we encountered: 
Since we live in different countries, it’s kinda difficult for us to communicate through online non-Chinese platform. We encountered problem with accessing UNNC online VPN couple of times. Communication is also a minor problem since we live in different countries, communicating online wasn’t as efficient as in person. 

Reflection: 
We would say, this project is a success for us. We did learn a lot in terms of both collaboration and coding counterparts. Even though there’s some issue/problem, we still developed a good friendship throughout the duration of the project.
