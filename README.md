# 2059

Patt and Max CW for Developing Maintainable Software (COMP2059 UNNC)


Brainstorming Ideas and Approx Timetable 
Date: 17 Nov 2022 First Online Meeting (for 1 hour)

We started Brainstorming ideas such as functions, special effects, ads on and so on

Minimal fixes plan:
- Add sound effect to the game (eg. background music, laser gun, asteroid explosion, etc)
- Make Asteroid appears from the top of the game, not randomly appears. (movement speed, normal size)

Features:
1. Amount of levels (varies by difficulty)
2. Limit world edges
3. Improvement on the game visual/ game object/ in-game interface (health bar) 
4. Function to upgrade weapons (varies by level) 
5. Ability to choose skin/design of the rocket before starting the game.

we used most of gitlab functions needed for the best experience of using gitlab. Such features were added: option button, background choice, level information, difficulty by level, weapon bonus up to 3rd stage and shuttle velocity increase on 3rd stage, final score showing after loss, world edges for shuttle and asteroids.
Collaborative efforts in refactoring techniques, features implementation and code design improvement led to the desired results.

max did: 
Most of the classes - code amount reduce and simplification 
Moved classes by folders 
(Ainâ€™t remember clearly, but maybe helped you with fixing background working I guess or smth, when I was in quarantine yet) 
All game features (multiple bullets based on level, shuttle velocity on 3rd stage, change of difficulties(speed+amount of asteroids),world edges for shuttle and asteroids)
